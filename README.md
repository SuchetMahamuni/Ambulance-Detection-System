# Ambulance-Detection-System
TensorFlow-based real-time ambulance detection system using Python and OpenCV
This project uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect ambulances in real-time from a live video feed. It was built to support smart traffic control for emergency vehicles.

## 🎯 Objective
Detect ambulances in a multi-vehicle traffic stream using object detection and identify the direction of arrival.
